## About My Task

<pre>
This task was built using laravel framework, and is ready to implement
user-role system.
The app currently uses admin role only and considers all other users as
non-admins.

The app uses bootstrap for the front-end design 
and ajax requests in some pages to fasten and simplify user experience.

Please feel free to contact me and ask about anything.
